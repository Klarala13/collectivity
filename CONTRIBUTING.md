It is an open source project, feel free to add to it anything you might feel is useful. 
To do so, you can either take one of the issues created and assign yourself to it, or you can add whatever functionality you might think is needed. 
Once you have it finished, create a pull request for me (Klara) to review the code and merge it! 

The first steps we need to take right now are:
1. Update dependencies and make sure what was done before works (some requests are failing now)
2. Change the colors being used to this new palette https://coolors.co/202a25-5f4bb6-86a5d9 througout the app
3. Change the font to Poppins.
