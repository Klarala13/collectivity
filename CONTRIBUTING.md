It is an open source project, feel free to add to it anything you might feel is useful. 
To do so, you can either take one of the issues created and assign yourself to it, or you can add whatever functionality you might think is needed. To do so, you may use the technology you find best fits the project´s needs, however, make sure it creates no conflict with other technologies and that it doesn´t impact performance too much. 
At any point, those changes may be reviewd. 

WORKFLOW:
When you are working on an issue/feature you will create a branch from develop that will have the name feature/featureYouAreImplementing. The pull request will be done to develop. Once changes are integrated, they will be merged with master. But only after seeing it creates no conflicts with the currently working version of the project.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: THANKS FOR CONTRIBUTING. Together, we can build tools to fight injustice, inequality and hopefully, even if it is just a little bit, make this world a better place.
